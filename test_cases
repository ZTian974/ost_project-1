U.S. Senators John McCain and Chris Murphy joined the rally Sunday.

KIEV, Ukraine — About 200,000 poured into the streets of the capital here Sunday as protests entered their fourth week amid increased pressure by the U.S. and its allies after the Ukrainian government backed away from a deal with the European Union.

"I want Ukraine in the EU, and I want the bandits out of their seats in the government," said Yuriy Mazur, 19, a student who came to Kiev from the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk to protest. "I will stay till we oust this government."

The anti-government protests began late last month after President Viktor Yanukovych decided to refrain from signing a trade deal with the European Union, instead seeking closer ties with Russia, a key trade partner.

On Tuesday, Yanukovych said he would sign the EU deal next spring. But two days later, Ukrainian officials announced that the president would go to Moscow on Tuesday to finalize a trade deal with Russia, prompting a large turnout Sunday in the hopes of derailing the initiative.

Michelle Bachelet wins Chile election run-off

Left-wing candidate Michelle Bachelet has been elected Chilean president for a second time, defeating her run-off rival by a wide margin.

With almost all votes counted, Ms Bachelet had 62% to 38% for Evelyn Matthei, a former minister from the ruling centre-right coalition.

Ms Bachelet first served as president in 2006-10, after which she was obliged by electoral laws to stand down.

The BBC's Gideon Long reports that education, constitution and electoral reform are all key to Ms Bachelet's plans.

About 4,500 mourners filled a vast domed tent for the state funeral, with relatives, princes, African leaders, celebrities and members of Mandela's ruling African National Congress arriving from dawn onward to say goodbye one last time.
Mandela was buried close to the graves of three of his children, on a hillside between his homestead and a highway in the small rural village of Qunu.

Bolstered by Flynn
Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo threw two interceptions in the game’s final three minutes. The first one, with the Cowboys in position to run out the clock, gave Green Bay a chance to take the lead, and Lacy delivered with a little more than a minute and a half left.

The Packers matched the feat of their 1982 team, which rallied past the Los Angeles Rams after trailing by 23, and kept their playoff hopes alive, with quarterback Aaron Rodgers possibly returning next week. The Cowboys blew a chance to pull even with Philadelphia in the N.F.C. East.

The Israeli military lodged a complaint with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, of the "outrageous breach of Israel's sovereignty" and has stepped up preparedness along the border, military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said in the statement.

Jang Song-thaek’s removal for planning to overthrow the state, corruption and other offences has increased concern about the direction of the country, given his family ties and powerful role.

Kim Jong-un’s aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, was mentioned in official media on Saturday for the first time since her husband’s removal. Named as one of those organising the funeral of a senior cadre, it indicated that she had not lost her position.

enate budget vote, few hopes for a productive 2014

The bipartisan budget compromise that passed the House by a wide margin last week has inspired House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to blast outside conservative groups that he said were using Republican members of Congress for their own gain. It has inspired kind words between the two legislators — Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) — who hammered out the deal. And it has inspired hope that, after years of governing by crisis, Congress may begin returning to something resembling regular order.

But that hope masks a deeply divided Senate, where ill will over recent rule changes has heightened a bitter partisan divide. As the Senate prepares to take up the budget deal this week, both sides say it is likely to be one of the final pieces of significant legislation to pass the 113th Congress as midterm elections loom.
